Introduction
============

Project Euler solutions in Ruby.  All solutions run in <1 minute on a 2.4ghz MacBook.

Conveniences
============

Use 'run' command to run through multiple solutions.  i.e.:

./run 1
./run 1-5
./run all

One can simply run the individual solutions as well, of course.  i.e.:

ruby 9.rb
